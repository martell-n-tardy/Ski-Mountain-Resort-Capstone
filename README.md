# Ski Mountain Resort Capstone
An end-to-end project completed for Whitefish Mountain Resort, located at Big Mountain in northwestern Montana. 

The goal of this project was to develop a pricing model for ski resort tickets in Big Mountain's market segment. Big Mountain suspected it may not be maximizing its returns, relative to its position in the market. They also didn't have a strong sense of what facilities matter most to visitors, particularly which ones vistors are most likely to pay more for. The deliverable is a predictive model intended to provide guidance for Big Mountain's pricing and future facility investment plans by exploring machine learning models and statistical analysis related to opportunity sizing, targeting, and optimization.
